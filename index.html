          <p>
            Coordinated demonstration and events on the theme of "Fund UW Now" are happening across the Universities 
            of Wisconsin this spring, led by AFT-Wisconsin local organizers. Together, we hope to draw attention to 
            the importance of fully funding our Universities and supporting public higher education. Our union members 
            care about working conditions for all educators and staff within the Universities of Wisconsin system, and 
            we are concerned about the many negative impacts on our students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unnecessary and politically-motivated funding cuts have harmed our campuses and communities. Recent 
            legislative overreaches withheld faculty raises in exchange for cuts to programs that promote diversity, 
            equity, and inclusion. By organizing these rolling events, union members across Wisconsin have a simple goal: 
            raise public awareness and keep this conversation in the headlines through February and March of the spring semester.

              <p>
                As professors, our primary duty is to educate students. The
                chronic defunding of public higher education over the course of
                decades has negatively impacted students in myriad ways:
              </p>

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                  <h3>Fewer course offerings</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Classes that students need for graduation are sometimes
                      canceled due to low enrollment, increasing time to
                      graduation and cost to the student. Fewer course offerings
                      over summer and winter reduce opportunities for students
                      to graduate early.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Shortage of faculty leads to fewer sections of required
                      courses. Students often face long waitlists for required
                      classes, increasing time to graduation and cost to the
                      student. In some cases, students are unable to take
                      classes intended for freshmen until their junior or senior
                      years.

                      Some schools have stopped offering foreign language
                      classes and majors due to low enrollments or inability to
                      hire professors. Knowing a second language is an important
                      tool in a global workforce.

                      Students whose degree programs are discontinued due to
                      faculty cuts must choose between transferring to a
                      different institution or trying to finish their degrees
                      with much reduced course offerings in their majors.

                    <li>
                      Campus closures reduce opportunities for students to take
                      classes closer to home, creating unnecessary barriers and
                      increasing cost.

                      In the past year, several UW two-year campuses have been
                      affected by diminishing enrollment and budget cuts driven
                      by austerity politics: UW-Platteville Richland is closing;
                      UW-Milwaukee at Washington County and UW-Oshkosh, Fond du
                      Lac Campus are ending in-person classes in June 2024;
                      UW-Green Bay, Marinette Campus is reducing face-to-face
                      teaching.

                      Disabled students are receiving less support through
                      disability services, creating unnecessary barriers to
                      success.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Student health services are not as robust or easily

                      schools.

                    <li>
                      Fewer faculty, instructors, and support staff have made it
                      difficult for students in crisis to find the help they
                      need.

                    <li>
                      Fewer support staff has made it difficult for

                    <li>
                      Increased class sizes and instructor workloads reduce the
                      amount of individualized attention professors can provide,
                      which is crucial for student retention and success.

                    <li>
                      The increase in professor workloads means they have less
                      time available for other student enrichment activities,
                      like club mentoring.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Having fewer professors able to advise students means less
                      individualized attention, making students more likely to
                      fall through the cracks.

                      Adjunctification, worsening job security and lower
                      compensation has increased professor turnover, which means
                      that if a student needs a letter of recommendation or to
                      finish an incomplete, that professor may no longer be
                      available.
